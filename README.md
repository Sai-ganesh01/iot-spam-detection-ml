# Efficient Spam Detection Technique for IoT Devices Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the final-year project documentation for detecting
spam or abnormal behaviour in IoT devices using classical machine learning
algorithms. The project focuses on identifying unusual smart-home energy
usage patterns using the REFIT Smart Home dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

IoT devices continuously generate sensor readings. Abnormal or spam-like
patterns may indicate malware, device misuse, or faults. This project
uses machine learning models to classify IoT behaviour into normal or
suspicious categories.

The project includes:

- Understanding IoT device behaviour  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Feature engineering for IoT traffic  
- Training and comparing ML models  
- Confusion matrix and accuracy evaluation

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were applied and evaluated:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN / Bagging)  
- Naive Bayes  

Each model was compared using:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- Confusion Matrix
